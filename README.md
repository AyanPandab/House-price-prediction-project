# House-price-prediction-project
Prediction of House Price Using Linear Regression ‐ Team project 
– Analyzed a House Price Dataset with 545 instances and 13 attributes with the goal of predicting housing prices using
data‐driven model and checked for missing values and duplicate values.
– Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify and understand
outliers while extracting additional insights from the data.
– Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables and applied multiple linear regression after removing the
insignificant numerical predictors, resulting in an adjusted R‐squared (R2) score of 0.604
